# GIGGLE2fusion pipeline

- gargs is just a parallelization tool, like xargs or gnu parallel
    - stdin redirection is usually a tab delimited file
    - {#} uses the #-th column value in the input file

1. GIGGLE search

- i: index
- g: gene name
- c: chromosome
- l: start base pair
- r: stop base pair
- o: outfile

```
gargs -p 60 --log=g.log -o "scripts/shell/genefusion_giggle.sh -i {0} -g {4} -c {1} -l {2} -r {3} -s {5} -o {6}" < i.txt
```

2. clean GIGGLE/excord file

- remove non-standard and "-1" chromosomes
- input {0}: GIGGLE/excord file
- output {1}: GIGGLE/excord file with some rows filtered

```
gargs -p 60 --log=g.log -o "./cln_excord.sh {0} {1}" < i.txt
```

3. temporarily swap the left and right hand interval

- fact: we only use the right-hand interval to find fusions; since, each GIGGLE file corresponds to a source gene
- purpose: 

swapping allows bedtools intersect of the right-hand interval with the left-hand preserved as metadata.
i want to keep both left/right intervals for an experiment comparing intervals of TP fusions and random PE evidence of genes

- input {0}: GIGGLE clean file
- output {1}: GIGGLE clean file with left and right hand intervals swapped

```
gargs -p 60 --log=g.log -o "./swap_intervals.sh {0} {1}" < i.txt
```

4. intersect

- purpose: 
    - fact: giggle search result returns all discordant paired end reads
    - goal: want to know if the other read (not the one in query gene) lands on another gene (a fusion!)

- input {0}: GIGGLE swapped file
- output {1}: BED file of intersections of right-hand interval and a gene bed file

```
gargs -p 60 --log=g.log -o "./intersect_swapped.sh {0} {1}" < i.txt
```

5. unswap intervals

- purpose: remove any confusion downstream by unswapping the left and right hand columns

- details:

- c1-5 is from genefile (the fusion target)
- c6-9 is right-hand (the fusion target)
- c10-13 is left-hand (the fusion source)
- c14 is ? (metadata)
- c15 is sample (metadata)

```
gargs -p 60 --log=g.log -o "./unswap_intervals.sh {0} {1}" < i.txt
```
